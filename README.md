# IBM Quantum Computing Challenge - Fall 2021

These are notes and notebooks from participation in the [IBM QC Fall 2021 Challenge](https://challenges.quantum-computing.ibm.com/fall-2021).

At the time, I completed all four sections up to the 'Advanced' level of the challenge (based on progress made in challenge 4).

I revisited this challenge recently and took more detailed notes the second time through.

TODO: revisit Challenge 4 and add detailed notes.
